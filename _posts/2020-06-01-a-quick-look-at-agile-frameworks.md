<img src="/uploads/bill-raymond.png" style="float:right;" width="200"/> Mention agile and there's a good chance frameworks like Scrum, SAFe and others will come up in the conversation. Today, I speak with my colleague John Corcoran to discuss the various agile frameworks and how they fit into the agile conversation. -Bill

### **Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll learn:**

* Why Toyota is a forward-thinking company
* Why should companies use the Kanban board?
* Working in a SCRUM way and how to get the most out of stand-up meetings
* How agile works for an enterprise and the cultural change that helps agile take root

### **In this episode…**

Agile has the power of helping a business transform their structure but for the framework to work, they need to have the capacity to adapt and embrace change. There are multiple approaches and philosophies of agile that often overlap with traditional ways of thinking and the cultural shifts that happen within a company must focus on the missing links to streamlining a conversation or project. And getting companies to effectively incorporate agile methods into companies is what Bill Raymond, Founder and CEO of Cambermast, is good at.

In this week's episode of Agile in Action, Bill Raymond gets interviewed by John Corcoran of Rise25 in his own show about the philosophies of agile and how they can be applied by businesses. Listen as he breaks down why agile works and why it fails, the importance of clients sticking to the agile framework rather than incorporating old philosophies and expecting it to work the same, and find out how companies can SCRUM their way of doing business. Stay Tuned.
